17:22:30 [8e335a636e] *CURRENT* <h3>Faster!</h3> * CHG: profiled the code with
         xdebug/webgrind and discovered that the metadata retrieval is the
         slowest factor. Therefore rewrote code to fetch metadata only once
         per displayed page. Saved a second or more on render. * CHG: no table
         used when only one column; this avoids the TOC pushdown effect. * 
         CHG: rewrote snippet function, clearer and more flexible. Now offers
         3 types: inline, plain and quoted, plus extent (length) options
         (based on new _shorten function, quite handy for future use) * CHG:
         renamed _get_options -> _build_sorting_array (more meaningful) (user:
         syanna tags: trunk)

17:27:42 [cd47a98bf6] * NEW: underline option for each page link row (subtle,
         but visible) * NEW: inline snippet option, up to no. of chars limit *
         NEW: better, rounded corners on outside border (user: syanna tags:
         trunk)

09:38:21 [a9fffd0c5a] * CHG: refactoring in _render_list function: better
         variable names; cleaner logic (user: syanna tags: trunk)
08:44:31 [04dceffe73] * FIX: changed plugin.info.txt EOL to LF (PHP style)
         (user: syanna tags: trunk)
08:38:28 [26de78332e] <h4>pagequery 0.7.1</h4> * CHG: refactored the mgroup
         function: separated the "by mixed args" option * CHG: allowed for
         user-defined keys to be returned by mgroup function * CSS: better
         colours/styling for "no results" message * FIX: better handling of
         "*" search queries: always converted to .* for page name queries * 
         FIX: added error override to search function, to ignore incorrect
         regex patterns * CHG: refactored render function into 1)
         _render_no_list and _render_list, plus _create_index. Easier to
         follow logic now * CHG: better allowance for column heights (result
         still affected line wraps on page links!); calculate a more realistic
         column height based on estimated ratios for headers * FIX: maxns in
         page_lookup function was incorrect ($this->maxns...) * REL: updated
         to 0.7.1 (user: syanna tags: trunk)

         trunk)

17:33:50 [8989537ef0] * FIX: fixed a whopping great big bug when list not
         grouped! Needed to reformat result list to include name and level
         too. (user: syanna tags: trunk)
